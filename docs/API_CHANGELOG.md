# API changelog

Changes of the HTTP API as clients see them, newest first. Every pull
request that changes `web/openapi.json` adds an entry here (rules:
[api-versioning.md](api-versioning.md)). `Spec:` is the first 16 hex digits
of the SHA-256 of `web/openapi.json` after the change
(`sha256sum web/openapi.json | cut -c1-16`); the newest entry must name the
committed description (`tests/platform/test_api_changelog.py`).

Kinds of change: **Added**, **Changed** (additive), **Deprecated** (with
sunset date), **Removed** and **Breaking** (only with the `api-breaking`
label and a migration path).

## 2026-10-02 — background job queue

Spec: `f4380cc473533ee9`

- **Added** `GET /v1/admin/jobs` (platform admins only): background jobs,
  the most recently changed first, paged with `limit` and `cursor` and
  filtered by `status` (`pending`, `running`, `done`, `dead`, `discarded`)
  and `name`. Job payloads are never returned.
- **Added** `POST /v1/admin/jobs/{job_id}/retry` (a dead or discarded job
  runs again) and `POST /v1/admin/jobs/{job_id}/discard` (a dead or waiting
  job is dropped). Both answer the job and the id of the audit entry that
  records the action; `409` when the job is in another state, `404` for an
  unknown job, `403` for anyone but a platform admin.
- **Added** schemas `QueuedJobView`, `QueuedJobPage`, `QueuedJobStatus`,
  `JobLane` and `AdminJobActionResult`.

## 2026-10-02

Spec: `1052b4e91d0ed103`

- **Changed** The JSON bodies of `POST /v1/businesses/{business_id}/billing/trial`,
  `.../billing/plan` and `.../billing/checkout` are described as optional
  (`requestBody.required: false`). The API already treated an empty body as
  all defaults; the description now says so.
- **Changed** Request bodies of the knowledge, resource and profile routes
  are read by the same parser as all other routes: an empty body is
  refused with `422 validation_failed` and validation messages no longer
  repeat submitted values; malformed path ids answer `404` with
  "<Entity> was not found." and invalid `?language=` values answer `422`
  without echoing the value. Shapes and status codes are unchanged.

## 2026-10-01 — `/v1` baseline

Spec: `bd53326db97cc3cc`

- **Added** The first described version of `/v1`: authentication with
  one-time codes, businesses and team, profile wizard, knowledge base,
  resources and schedules, assistant versions and autotests, conversations,
  bookings, leads, handoffs, unanswered questions, dashboard, channels and
  the website widget, billing and Flitt payments, compliance (DPA, audit
  log, customer data requests), catalog and platform administration.
